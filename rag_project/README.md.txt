# RAG-based Question Answering using Endee Vector Database

## Overview
This project demonstrates a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Endee vector database.
Documents are converted into vector embeddings and relevant information is retrieved based on user queries.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Endee Vector Database
- Sentence Transformers
- Vector Search

## Project Structure
- data/: contains input documents
- app.py: main application logic
- requirements.txt: dependencies

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies  
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the application  
   python app.py

## Output
The system retrieves the most relevant document based on semantic similarity.
